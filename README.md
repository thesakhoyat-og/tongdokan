## Security Notes

- All database queries use **prepared statements** to prevent SQL injection
- Sessions are used for authentication — staff and customers have separate sessions
- Role-based access control — each staff member can only access their own dashboard
- Passwords are stored as plain text (suitable for academic demo — production would use password_hash())
